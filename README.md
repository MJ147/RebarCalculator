# RebarCalculator
Calculator for diameter and spacing of reinforcement bars in the structure slab.

## General info
Algorithms and formulas using in this program are based on "Eurocode 2: Design of concrete structures" - European standard in structure designing. The program is usefull in structural designer work, when calculating slabs. Its main purpose is convert bending moment which is in the slab to the required number of bars with specific diameter and spacing between them.
